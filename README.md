DON'T MERGE TO MASTER UNTIL MORE MEETINGS

This is a preliminary commit for basics like file/folder structure.
This is no way a set in stone approach, I more or less saw how IntelliJ
handled nodejs projects and went from there. 

You'll also notice there are jade files instead of html files.  Jade seems pretty awesome and is probably worth 
looking into, makes html a bit easier.

So, like I said, this is the folder structure I was using for our nodejs setup that we'll use later to run tests
and put it all together.  app.js holds all the server stuff, for now it'll just run on your localhost
I'm using a mac (if that matters) and it's set to http://localhost:3000
Jeffrey also made it work on the server at: http://capdev.meyersj.com:3000

Also, feel free to change up folder structure to what you need (I know we'll have D3 stuff and neo4j stuff incoming
and we may need to add and move stuff)
